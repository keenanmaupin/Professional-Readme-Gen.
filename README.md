## Description

🪝[Quick-Referance-I.D.] 
- A README.md Generator

🪝[In-Depth-I.D.] 
- To make creating a README.md quicker and easier.
- It was built so for future projects the user would be able to copile the basic information they needed for a README prior to working through the code. 
- Having to go back and create a README.md later on and have set targets tto address was the reasoning behind this tool.
- How to write files in the terminal is what we learned here.
- Its character and efficiency to complete its main task seen here in this very README makes it stand out; everything I would think of if I was putting 
  together one.
